<h5>2014-2016</h5>

<p>I guided and mentored a cohort of 40 low-income students through the college application and financial aid process throughout their junior and senior years. I continually refined messaging and developed college preparation curriculum for six weekly after-school sessions to reach and engage a diverse cohort of students. I met rigorous benchmarks set by the organization annually by closely monitoring my students’ progress, creating and managing organizational systems, and fostering community within my cohort. I raised student ACT scores by an average of 27%, wrote 40 letters of recommendation, and recruited two full cohorts of College Possible students.</p>
